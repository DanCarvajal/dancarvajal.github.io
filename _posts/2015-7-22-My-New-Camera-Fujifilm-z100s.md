Recently I managed to purchase a camera I have had my eyes one for almost two years, a Fujifilm x100s. It's a very unique camera built around the experience of taking photos more than the battle of specs that a lot of cameras battle.

It's also a very retro looking and feeling camera. It looks right at home sitting next to my Grandfather's Apla Relex 9d (as seen in the above photo).

I love the in camera skin tones that the camera has.
