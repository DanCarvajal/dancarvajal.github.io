It's no secret that I am a big Google fan (but not a fanboy), so when they announced their [Project Fi](https://fi.google.com) wireless service of course I wanted in. I quickly put in an invite application and just last week I finally got my invite. As of yesterday I am officially on Google's Project Fi. Here's some quick thoughts on my day of using the service:

* In theory ProjectFi is almost exactly what I've always wanted in a wireless carrier. It's cheap, simple to set up, easy to pay your bill, and gives great coverage. AndroidPolice did a great breakdown of it's [potential as a service](http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/04/22/editorial-googles-project-fi-may-not-be-the-carrier-you-want-but-i-sure-as-hell-do/). I don't think it even required a credit check, which I consider a completely unnecessary aspect of cell phone service, it's not the 1990s after all.
* For those not familiar the concept behind ProjectFi it's a virtual mobile network that runs on both Sprint and T-Mobile's networks. Basically most phones these days can run on any cellular network regardless of which carrier you buy service from. One way to create the largest coverage network possible is to combine networks together, which is what they've done. I've yet to notice any issues with my phone transitioning between Wifi, T-Mobile, and Sprint's networks. So far everything just works. The only catch for some people is that currently the only supported phone is the Nexus6.
* Everything for the service is managed through the ProjectFi app. The app itself is well put together and represents Google at it's best when it comes to app design. I could really get used most of my services being handled through similar apps.
* They gave me a nice [welcome kit](http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/06/02/google-is-apparently-giving-project-fi-customers-who-also-ordered-a-nexus-6-welcome-kits-containing-a-case-earbuds-and-an-external-battery/) when I activated the service. The Casemate Nexus6 case included is the best of the three cases I've used yet with my Nexus6. It has just enough protection without adding too much bulk to an already very large phone.

ProjectFi's long game for Google (or maybe Alphabet) is fun to speculate about. I personally think ProjectFi a bet for Google to get on a future of ubiquitous wireless internet, full of consumers that they want unhindered access to, access that I doubt they think they can get from Verizon. While there may be plans for further Google Fiber (or just Fiber now) expansion I think Google is hedging their bet on how people will access the internet in the future. I'd be interested to see how Facebook responds, as Google's main rival in this area of consumer internet services.
