title: Mad Max Fury Road Review
---
If you've been around me for the past two months you've probably heard me talk about *Mad Max Fury Road*. I'm no attempt at hiding this Fury Road is not only now one of my favorite movies but a film that I consider a masterpiece. Since I love a lot of movies that people don't like, and dislike a lot of movies that people do, I wanted to give the film a larger breakdown of why I love this film. **As with all my review there are no Spoilers in this review.**

###Setting the Stage: The State of Action Films

I want to set the stage first on the state of action films and what that means for *Fury Road*.

####Super Heroes and Special Effects

Modern action films have been defined for almost the past ten years by Super Hero films and increasing use of digital special effects. We have seen multiple alien invasions of cities, flying cities, and gravity defying cars.

###The Film

This movie is a masterpiece of editing, pacing, tone, action, character, and world construction. It's visual ecstasy on film, and a testimony to what modern films can be, oddly coming from such an old school film. George Miller is a 70 year old filmmaker, yet has created a film so inventive you couldn't possibly imagine it not coming from some young renegade filmmaker looking to reinvent the genre.

It's action packed and violent, and while touching on many levels. It captures the horror of a punk/heavy-metal post apocalyptic wasteland, and the hearts of those just trying to survive. It's feminist in its treatment of women. The female characters are just as resourceful and utilitarian as the men, they are not objects to the film. It's ruthlessly logical, and beautifully insane all at the same time.

Characters behave logically within the film's established world and they can only do so because of the detail built into the world. There's a commitment to physicality that you don't see in films these days (Shia Lebeouf just fell 30 stories out of a building but it's okay because he was caught by a giant metal robot!)

Above all it's a film that trust the audience. It let's you put together the pieces of the plot and its world as you see it and at no point babies the audience with expository dialog. You are thrown into the world, like the characters themselves, and are left to figure everything out in the race for survival.

I don't know how a film this good got made in modern global Hollywood. Damn am I glad it did. It came roaring in from the desert with hope.


###Case Study: How to Make a Title Card.

 {% include image.html url="http://i.imgur.com/NW8NYQG.gif" description="Fury Road Title Card" %}

Above is the title card for *Fury Road*. In film, title cards are art elements that can be ignored or embraced to benefit of a film. You can have minimalist title card meant to not detract from the immersiveness of the film, or they can be tone setting (ex: Star Wars) and given their own place within the film. What a film chooses to do with a title card says a lot of how the film was made.

Few title cards lately have had the detail put into them as *Fury Road*. Entire scenes were created to lead to the title card to intimately connect it to an actual moment within the film. Even the type was physically cut out of metal in a desire to match the physical would Mille created for the film. It's tactile and has weight to it's movement and more work went into the sound design for it than goes into most films.
