title: Mad Max Fury Road Review
---

This movie is a masterpiece of editing, pacing, tone, action, character, and world construction. It's visual ecstasy on film, and a testimony to what modern films can be, oddly coming from such an old school film. It's action packed and violent, and touching on many levels. It captures the horror of a punk/heavy metal post apocalyptic wasteland, and the hearts of those just trying to survive. It's feminist in its treatment of women, the female characters are just as resourceful and utilitarian as the men. It's ruthlessly logical, and beautifully insane all at the same time.

Above all it's a film that trust the audience. It let's you put together the pieces of the plot and its world as you see it and at no point babies the audience with expository dialog. You are thrown into the world, like the characters themselves, and are left to figure everything out in the race for survival.
I don't know how a film this good got made in modern global Hollywood. Damn am I glad it did. It came roaring in from the desert with hope.
