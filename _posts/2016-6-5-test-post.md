title: Learning to Make Mexican Food
author: Dan Carvajal
---
One week ago today, I made the worst dinner I have ever cooked. The horror stories of this dinner are so bad I wont share them all here. (I poorly washed the arugula and Cassie had to spit tiny rocks out of her mouth.) While I disastrously screwed the evening up, but my heart was in the right place, I'm trying to learn to make really good Mexican food.
