I would like to kick off my first post in my [Open Protfolio](https://github.com/DanCarvajal/free_stuff) repository with some of my latest work.

I recently had to make something with a Washington, DC skyline and I could not find any readily available vector skyline that would work for my purposes. Being without a skyline, I created my own and have put the main building features up on the Github in [SVG form](https://github.com/DanCarvajal/free_stuff/blob/master/Washington_DC_buildings.svg).
